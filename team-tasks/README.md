# Team Tasks — Multi-Agent Pipeline Coordination

A Python CLI tool for coordinating multi-agent development workflows through shared JSON task files. Designed for use with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and AI agent orchestration systems.

## Features

Three coordination modes for different workflows:

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Linear** | Sequential pipeline with auto-advance | Bug fixes, simple features, step-by-step workflows |
| **DAG** | Dependency graph with parallel dispatch | Large features, spec-driven dev, complex dependencies |
| **Debate** | Multi-agent position + cross-review | Code reviews, architecture decisions, competing hypotheses |

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ (stdlib only, no external dependencies)
- Data stored as JSON in `/home/ubuntu/clawd/data/team-tasks/` (override with `TEAM_TASKS_DIR` env var)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/win4r/team-tasks.git

# No pip install needed — it's a standalone script
python3 team-tasks/scripts/task_manager.py --help
```

For OpenClaw skill integration, copy to your skills directory:
```bash
cp -r team-tasks/ /path/to/clawd/skills/team-tasks/
```

## Quick Start

### Mode A: Linear Pipeline

A sequential pipeline where agents execute one after another in order.

```bash
TM="python3 scripts/task_manager.py"

# 1. Create project with pipeline order
$TM init my-api -g "Build REST API with tests and docs" \
  -p "code-agent,test-agent,docs-agent,monitor-bot"

# 2. Assign tasks to each stage
$TM assign my-api code-agent "Implement Flask REST API: GET/POST/DELETE /items"
$TM assign my-api test-agent "Write pytest tests, target 90%+ coverage"
$TM assign my-api docs-agent "Write README with API docs and examples"
$TM assign my-api monitor-bot "Security audit and deployment readiness check"

# 3. Check what's next
$TM next my-api
# ▶️  Next stage: code-agent

# 4. Dispatch → work → save result → mark done
$TM update my-api code-agent in-progress
# ... agent does work ...
$TM result my-api code-agent "Created app.py with 3 endpoints"
$TM update my-api code-agent done
# ▶️  Next: test-agent  (auto-advance!)

# 5. Check progress anytime
$TM status my-api
```

**Output example:**
```
📋 Project: my-api
🎯 Goal: Build REST API with tests and docs
📊 Status: active  |  Mode: linear
▶️  Current: test-agent

  ✅ code-agent: done
     Task: Implement Flask REST API
     Output: Created app.py with 3 endpoints
  🔄 test-agent: in-progress
     Task: Write pytest tests, target 90%+ coverage
  ⬜ docs-agent: pending
  ⬜ monitor-bot: pending

  Progress: [██░░] 2/4
```

### Mode B: DAG (Dependency Graph)

Tasks declare dependencies and run in parallel when deps are met.

```bash
TM="python3 scripts/task_manager.py"

# 1. Create DAG project
$TM init my-feature -m dag -g "Build search feature with parallel workstreams"

# 2. Add tasks with dependencies
$TM add my-feature design     -a docs-agent  --desc "Write API spec"
$TM add my-feature scaffold   -a code-agent  --desc "Create project skeleton"
$TM add my-feature implement  -a code-agent  -d "design,scaffold" --desc "Implement API"
$TM add my-feature write-tests -a test-agent -d "design"          --desc "Write test cases from spec"
$TM add my-feature run-tests  -a test-agent  -d "implement,write-tests" --desc "Run all tests"
$TM add my-feature write-docs -a docs-agent  -d "implement"             --desc "Write final docs"
$TM add my-feature review     -a monitor-bot -d "run-tests,write-docs"  --desc "Final review"

# 3. Visualize the DAG
$TM graph my-feature
```

**Graph output:**
```
📋 my-feature — DAG Graph

├─ ⬜ design [docs-agent]
│  ├─ ⬜ implement [code-agent]
│  │  ├─ ⬜ run-tests [test-agent]
│  │  │  └─ ⬜ review [monitor-bot]
│  │  └─ ⬜ write-docs [docs-agent]
│  └─ ⬜ write-tests [test-agent]
└─ ⬜ scaffold [code-agent]
   └─ ⬜ implement (↑ see above)

  Progress: [░░░░░░░] 0/7
```

```bash
# 4. Get ready tasks (parallel dispatch!)
$TM ready my-feature
# 🟢 Ready to dispatch (2 tasks):
#   📌 design → agent: docs-agent
#   📌 scaffold → agent: code-agent

# 5. Dispatch both in parallel, then mark done
$TM update my-feature design done
# 🟢 Unblocked: write-tests  ← auto-detected!

$TM update my-feature scaffold done
# 🟢 Unblocked: implement

# 6. Continue until all complete
$TM ready my-feature  # Shows newly unblocked tasks
```

**Key DAG features:**
- `ready` returns ALL tasks whose deps are satisfied — dispatch them simultaneously
- `ready --json` includes `depOutputs` — previous stage results to pass to agents
- Automatic unblock notifications when a task completes
- Cycle detection on `add` — rejects tasks that would create circular dependencies
- Partial failure: unrelated branches continue; only downstream tasks block

### Mode C: Debate (Multi-Agent Deliberation)

Send the same question to multiple agents, collect positions, cross-review, and synthesize.

```bash
TM="python3 scripts/task_manager.py"

# 1. Create debate project
$TM init security-review --mode debate \
  -g "Review auth module for security vulnerabilities"

# 2. Add debaters with roles/perspectives
$TM add-debater security-review code-agent  --role "security expert focused on injection attacks"
$TM add-debater security-review test-agent  --role "QA engineer focused on edge cases"
$TM add-debater security-review monitor-bot --role "ops engineer focused on deployment risks"

# 3. Start initial round
$TM round security-review start
# 🗣️  Debate Round 1 (initial) started
# Outputs dispatch prompts for each debater

# 4. Collect initial positions
$TM round security-review collect code-agent  "Found SQL injection in login()"
$TM round security-review collect test-agent  "Missing input validation on email field"
$TM round security-review collect monitor-bot "No rate limiting on auth endpoints"
# ✅ Round 1 (initial) is complete.
# ➡️  Next: round security-review cross-review

# 5. Generate cross-review prompts
$TM round security-review cross-review
# 🔁 Each debater gets others' positions + review instructions

# 6. Collect cross-reviews
$TM round security-review collect code-agent  "Agree on validation. Rate limiting is critical."
$TM round security-review collect test-agent  "SQL injection is most severe. Adding rate limit tests."
$TM round security-review collect monitor-bot "Both findings valid. Recommending WAF as additional layer."

# 7. Synthesize all positions
$TM round security-review synthesize
# 🧾 Outputs all initial positions + cross-reviews for final synthesis
```

**Debate workflow diagram:**
```
Question → [Agent A] → Position A ─┐
         → [Agent B] → Position B ─┤── Cross-Review ── Synthesis
         → [Agent C] → Position C ─┘
```

## Integration with OpenClaw

This tool is designed as an [OpenClaw Skill](https://docs.openclaw.ai). The orchestrating agent (AGI) dispatches tasks to worker agents via `sessions_send` and tracks state through the CLI.

**Dispatch loop (linear):**
```
1. next <project> --json           → get next stage info
2. update <project> <agent> in-progress
3. sessions_send(agent, task)      → dispatch to agent
4. Wait for agent reply
5. result <project> <agent> "..."  → save output
6. update <project> <agent> done   → auto-advances to next stage
7. Repeat
```

**Dispatch loop (DAG):**
```
1. ready <project> --json          → get ALL dispatchable tasks
2. For each ready task (parallel):
   a. update <project> <task> in-progress
   b. sessions_send(agent, task + depOutputs)
3. On reply: result → update done → check newly unblocked
4. Repeat until all tasks complete
```

## Common Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Linear mode: Stage ID = agent name, NOT a number

```bash
# ❌ WRONG — "stage '1' not found"
python3 scripts/task_manager.py assign my-project 1 "Build API"

# ✅ CORRECT
python3 scripts/task_manager.py assign my-project code-agent "Build API"
```

### ⚠️ DAG: Dependencies must exist before referencing

```bash
# ❌ WRONG — "dependency 'design' not found"
$TM add my-project implement -a code-agent -d "design"

# ✅ CORRECT — add deps first
$TM add my-project design -a docs-agent --desc "Write spec"
$TM add my-project implement -a code-agent -d "design" --desc "Implement"
```

### ⚠️ Debate: Cannot add debaters after rounds start

```bash
# ❌ WRONG
$TM round my-debate start
$TM add-debater my-debate new-agent  # Error!

# ✅ CORRECT — add all debaters before starting
$TM add-debater my-debate agent-a
$TM add-debater my-debate agent-b
$TM round my-debate start
```

## Data Storage

Project files are stored as JSON at:
```
/home/ubuntu/clawd/data/team-tasks/<project>.json
```
